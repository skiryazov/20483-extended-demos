# 20483-extended-demos
Some extra demos for the 20483 course - Programming in C#, preparation for the 70-483 exam

Some of these are based on existing Microsoft demos from https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20483-Programming-in-C-Sharp/, some are brand new. They are meant to be an aid to Firebrand Ltd. instructors teaching the 20483 course as Firebrand also has a proprietary demo guide but could be helpful to other instructors or self-paced learners. The structure of the repo follows the module numbers from the Microsoft course but some modules don't have extended demos.
